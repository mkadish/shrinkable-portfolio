    <p>I've been using HTML and the like for nearly ten years, back since the days of geocities.</p>
    <P>I've worked on a few websites, nothing big, I guess most of my HTML usage was for ebay listings.  Honestly, most of what I made I simply made with notepad, so I guess I wasn't as strict as I should have been.</P>
    <P>One of the things I have to remember more is to close my tags (especially &ltp&gt's and &ltli&gt's), using &ltem&gt and &ltstrong&gt instead of &lti&gt and &ltb&gt, and not abuse titles and the like, trying to keep it ordered, like you said.  Organization is proving much harder than I anticipated though.</P>
    <p>Ok, I'll be honest, this is the same bio information I used from the exercise we did in class, but I kind of figure that us writing out bios isn't the focus of the course, and it feels a little vain to keep trying to talk about myself like this.</p>
    <P>So...I can stop here, right?</P>
